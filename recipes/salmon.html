        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 salmon seasoned as you please</li>

                <li>3 shallots</li>
                    
                <li> ~ 1/4 (250g) sticks softened salted butter</li>
                    
                <li>250 ml dry white wine (I used a white cooking wine  instead)</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375 F </li>

                <li>Get a pot and fill it about a quarter with water</li>
                    
                <li>Set this on the stove to start boiling</li>
                    
                <li>the shallots as small as you can without mincing</li>
                    
                <li>   Take a pan and add the white wine and shallots on medium heat</li>
                    
                   <li> This will sit and reduce. You will want the wine to go down to about 2 tablespoons worth. This will be maybe 10 minutesWhile that's going on take your salmon and season. I used a tray, added about 2 tablespoons of olive oil, set the salmon on that and then added garlic salt and lemon juice for flavor. I also wasn't paying attention and added vanilla extract instead of lemon but only a slight bit. The color difference clicked in my head 
                    eventually and didn't ruin my taste. Also not a revolutionary new thing either. Don't do that. Pay attention.

                   <li>Cover the salmon and add to the oven for 15 minutes</li>
                    
                   <li> Take the butter and slice it into mini patties like youâ€™d  get at a family-style restaurant </li>
                    
                   <li> When the shallot wine mix has reduced enough, add a glass or non-wimpy bowl to top of the boiling water to create a double boiler. Add the shallot and wine mix to this. </li>
                    
                    <li>the butter patties one at a time and whisk until it melts before adding the next</li>
                    
                    <li> You can add a couple at a time, just keep adding until it's all mixed in </li>
                    
                    <li>Keep this warm while the salmon cooks</li>
                    
                   <li> After the 15 minutes uncover and cook for another 15. Internal temp should be 145 F</li>
                    
                    <li>Pour the sauce on your finished salmon</li>
            </ol>
